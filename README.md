# Musory
tell your story, your way.

## The Idea

People love to share. It makes sense then that there are a lot of online sharing platforms out there: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and more. Yet, to really be clear, those platforms aren't sharing platforms - they're social media platforms.

The idea of a "quality tweet" or a "like-to-minute ratio" on an Instagram post means that we're not sharing for us - we're sharing for our followers. That leaves half of our stories and thoughts forgotten in this so-called quality anxiety.

Musory is sharing for you. Make a photo muse. Write a three page story. Share a passing thought. There are no likes or hearts, no good or bad entries, no follower counts. Nothing is off limits.

Musory lets you capture all those moments that maybe aren't perfect enough for the big screen. After all, aren't those the moments that say the most?
